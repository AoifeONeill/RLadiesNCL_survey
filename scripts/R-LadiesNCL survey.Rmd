We want to hear what the community would like to see from R-Ladies Newcastle! We sent a survey both to those who could and couldn't attend our first meetup.We wanted to hear our communities opinions so that we can make sure we create an inclusive space with events they want to attend.

Below we have created some visualisations from the data we received.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)
survey_data <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("R-Ladies Newcastle Survey (Responses).xlsx"))

## What is the range of experience for our community?


```{r Experience}

my.labels <- c("I am a \nbeginner or\nnew to R", 
               "I am \nprogramming \nbut not in R",
               "I am \nusing R \nregularly", 
               "I have some \nexperience with R")
Experience_graph <- Experience_graph_data %>%
   ggplot(aes(x =`What is your experience with R?`,y = n,
        fill = `What is your experience with R?`))+
